Description
===========

This project has been abandoned in favor of [collectd's GenericJMX plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:GenericJMX)

Woof is a library and daemon to poll JVMs for JMX data. It will also
support polling JBOSS 7's HTTP-JSON management interface.

Woof relies heavily on Thomas Enebo's excellent jmxjr gem
